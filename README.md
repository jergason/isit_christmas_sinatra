IS IT CHRISTMAS?
===============

##NO (most likely)
But check for sure at
[http://is-it-christmas.heroku.com](http://is-it-christmas.heroku.com).

This was just a simple thing I whipped up while in the festive spirit.
It is very much inspired by the
[https://github.com/isit/christmas](https://github.com/isit/christmas)
project. Translations came from
[http://users.elite.net/runner/jennifers/no.htm](http://users.elite.net/runner/jennifers/no.htm).

Right now it is set up for a Heroku deployment, but hey, it is a Sinatra
project. It shouldn't be that hard to deploy somewhere else.

It uses the [hostip.info](http://hostip.info) API for doing IP address
lookup.
